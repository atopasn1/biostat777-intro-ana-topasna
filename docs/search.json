    "text": "Here I am working with the ToothGrowth data in base R. In this data set either a vitamin suppliment or plain orange juice was given to guinea pigs to determine if one was better for tooth growth. My analysis will be to look at a certain dose (0.5) and see if their is a statistically significant difference between the growth for the vitamin or the juice.
