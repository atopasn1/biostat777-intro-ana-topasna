## Thesis Work
My thesis work is on understanding non CF-bronceiechatsis with 3 main aims:

1 Determine the genetic causes of non-CF broncheiechtasis
2 Search for undiagnosed CF in the non broncheiechtasis cohort and catagorize and study any variants we find
3 Determine if current CF modulators are an eligible therapy for this population

If you're interested in more I've included some of my posters below!
